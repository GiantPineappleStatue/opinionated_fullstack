# Frontend Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the frontend codebase to align with the Bulletproof React architecture and the master checklist requirements.

## Current Status

We have implemented the Bulletproof React architecture with:
- Feature-based organization for auth, user, and profile features
- TanStack Query for API calls
- Proper router context for authentication
- Enhanced error handling with logging

## Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Feature Organization

- [x] Organize auth feature
  - [x] Create auth API with TanStack Query
  - [x] Create auth hooks
  - [x] Create auth components
  - [x] Update auth provider to use new hooks

- [x] Organize user feature
  - [x] Create user API with TanStack Query
  - [x] Create user hooks
  - [x] Create user components
  - [x] Create user routes

- [x] Organize profile feature
  - [x] Create profile API with TanStack Query
  - [x] Create profile hooks
  - [x] Create profile components
  - [x] Create profile routes

### 2. TanStack Query Implementation

- [x] Implement TanStack Query for auth
- [x] Implement TanStack Query for user management
- [x] Implement TanStack Query for profile management
- [ ] Ensure all API calls use TanStack Query
- [ ] Implement proper query invalidation
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

### 3. Clean Up

- [ ] Remove unused files and functions
- [ ] Remove duplicate code
- [x] Ensure consistent naming conventions
- [x] Update imports to use direct file paths (avoid index files)

### 4. Testing

- [ ] Add unit tests for hooks
- [ ] Add unit tests for components
- [ ] Add integration tests for features

### 5. Documentation

- [x] Document feature architecture
- [ ] Document API hooks
- [ ] Document components

### 6. Error Handling

- [x] Implement error logging service
- [x] Enhance error boundary component
- [x] Improve API error handling
- [x] Add detailed error messages

## Implementation Strategy

1. **One Feature at a Time**: Refactor one feature at a time to minimize disruption
2. **Test as You Go**: Ensure each refactored feature works before moving to the next
3. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, incremental changes rather than large rewrites
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

## Priority Order

1. Auth feature (completed)
2. User management feature (completed)
3. Profile feature (completed)
4. Error handling (completed)
5. Clean up and testing

## Timeline

- Week 1: Complete auth feature refactoring (completed)
- Week 2: Complete user management feature refactoring (completed)
- Week 3: Complete profile feature refactoring (completed)
- Week 4: Clean up and testing
